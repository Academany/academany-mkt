# Soft Academy

Soft Academy is a transdisciplinary course that focuses on the development of new technologies applied in the textile industry, in its broad range of applications, from the fashion industry and the upcoming wearable market.
The two phase program will last 6 months, with approximately 3 months of seminars and learning modules and three months focusing on individual in depth applied project research.

The fashion industry is one of the most traditional and the 2nd most polluting in the world after oil. Today 20% of water pollution globally is caused by textile processing and consumers worldwide spent US$1.7 trillion on clothing in 2014. The production of the clothes we use is sustained over devastating social consequences in countries like Bangladesh and China, where labour exploitation holds the low prices we love to pay in H&M, Zara and other fast fashion brands.

The textile and clothing industry needs to explore and start to implement more viable, sustainable and fair alternatives systems of today. The program will focus on the unethical and environmentally unfriendly realities of the current industry, while combining the knowledge of traditional and future craftsmanship to work towards new ways of designing, prototyping and producing for the slowly changing textile and fashion-industry.

More than 50 years ago, science fiction authors such as Asimov predicted video conferencing systems, remote learning, artificial intelligence, and mostly all the advanced technologies we are deploying in our life today. The ubiquity of knowledge and information is transforming culture and learning processes for people, changing completely the way we work, live and play. Hyper connectivity through digital platforms is becoming symbiotic with the physical realm, creating synergies between bits and atoms in places like Fab Labs, Makerspaces, BiotechLabs, Innovation hubs and TextileLabs all over the planet.
Digital fabrication laboratories are becoming incubators for innovative technologies and creators of spin offs and disruptive initiatives that are being implemented in the “real” world.

The possibilities to conduct experimental research in a open laboratory gives the physical and mental space for innovative re-thinking and reframing of todays realities, offering the resources for visions to be materialised, tested, developed and make an active impact in people’s life, no as a linear process, but as a spiral iteration and implementation in the reality.
Through the program of the Academy we are developing and implementing a new approach on to how create, produce and distribute textile and fashion elements, by using distributed manufacturing infrastructures and knowledge networks.
Along with experts from the field, the participants will investigate how the textile and fashion industry can benefit from new technologies, processes and business models.
We are experimenting with the human body, culture and mindset by recycling, hacking and sensing it, creating feedback loops with project development, where materials, aesthetics, sustainability and customisation play equal and important roles. The academy offers a cross-disciplinary education and research platform, where production and culture through advanced technologies are making impact in the way we think and act towards the textile industry and all of its application fields. Working locally, while creating connected communities globally. We are not waiting for things to change, we are changing them from the ground up.
