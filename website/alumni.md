“For the last few years, I have also developed a big interest in education:
How can we link child development and fulfillment with technologies and design ?
Alongside the Fab Academy, I have collaborated with Houghton Valley School and Fab Lab Wgtn in order to initiate a group of 6 children from 9 to 10 years old into the digital fabrication. My Fab Academy classes are the story line of the workshops. The children also participate in the creation of my final project!”
