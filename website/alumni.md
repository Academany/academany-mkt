#### ANNA AFLALO  – FAB ACADEMY 2015
Fab Lab Wgtn (New Zealand)  

“I Graduated from both a french business school and an engineering school, I am now specialized in management and innovation. With the Fab Academy, I improved my ability to rapid prototypes and learned about different production techniques.”

“For the last few years, I have also developed a big interest in education:
How can we link child development and fulfillment with technologies and design ?
Alongside the Fab Academy, I have collaborated with Houghton Valley School and Fab Lab Wgtn in order to initiate a group of 6 children from 9 to 10 years old into the digital fabrication. My Fab Academy classes are the story line of the workshops. The children also participate in the creation of my final project!”

I’m born in farming family in a small village near Vigyan Ashram Fab lab. After completing engineering, I joined Fab Academy. It has helped me with expertise in core electronics, programming and designing. I have selected my Fab Academy project on precision agriculture. After graduation, I have continued to work on it. I have installed it with two farmers in Pabal village. I am now working on standardizing my design and developing more instruments with Fab Lab to meet challenges of water scarcity regions. Currently working as Fab Lab Manager at Vigyan Ashram.

#### Supriya Kadam, Fabacademy 2016

I was and studied small village Patan. I visited Vigyan Ashram during my engineering college days as part of study tour. I have a dream of starting my business but was very confused. Hence decided to join Fab Lab at Vigyan Ashram. During Fab Academy course, I was able to put my academic knowledge into practice and also learn advance techniques in the field. Peer learning from local as well as global friends helped me to acquire knowledge. My Fab Academy project of 'Rangoli Making machine' set me on the track of making plotters. Recently I got order for making similar plotter from small shopkeeper. This is my first commercial order. I also made stirrer which work on solar energy. Hope to make more such products and build my company.
