# Applications open for Bio Academy 2017!

(Press release date)

At the end of August, groups of students all around the globe will tune in once again for lectures in the Bio Academy.
Faculty from Harvard, MIT, Tufts, UV Madison, Epibone, Ginkgo Bioworks and more team up to teach an astonishing collection of classes on the applications and implications of synthetic biology.

Ranging from the creation of nanoscopic structures using DNA folding, the use of cutting edge techniques such as CRISP-CAS 9 and FISSEQ, to the engineering of the microbiome, fabrication with biological materials and the promise of Gene drives, Bio Academy teaches you **How to Grow (almost) Anything.**

The curriculum for Bio Academy is developed by Professor George Church, and faculty are all at the forefront of the fields that they teach in. Students can join this advanced course in labs all around the globe, and follow the lectures via video conferencing that happens every Wednesday at 9am EDT. The course runs from end of August till the first half of December and requires a enrolement fee of 5000,- USD that is used for local costs and central organization. While students follow lectures via video, the courses are live and interaction with faculty is constant during the lessons. Students have what they need to complete homework locally (bio labs) and are part of a international group of students persuing the same goal; learning How to Grow (almost) Anything.

Bio Academy is one of the programs run by The Academy of Almost Anything, also known as The Academany. Another program which is currently ongoing is the Fab Academy, or How to Make (almost) Anything, a course that originated from the MIT and is directed by professor Neil Gershenfeld of the Center for Bits and Atoms. There are also other educational programs under preparation like Why To Make (almost) Anything which will be directed by Olafur Eliasson and Machines That Make by MIT's Phd. Nadya Peek.
