* All the basic course materials

* Free software licenses for selected Autodesk and Solidworks software packages during the course

**Scholarships**

You can apply for a partial grant or a scholarship to your local lab, often provided in exchange of some work contribution to the lab.

**Is there any accreditation?**

There is no global accreditation for these skills. Instead, each student builds a portfolio that documents their mastery of them individually, and their integration.

These are reviewed by their local instructors, regional gurus, and then centrally to ensure that each student meets global standards and follows evolving best practices.

The Bio Diploma is earned by progress rather than the calendar, for successful completion of a series of certificate requirements. The instructional sequence requires six months to cover, and the time to finish has ranged from that up to a few years.
