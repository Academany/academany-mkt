**The Bio Academy teaches principles and applications of synthetic biology**


**How did it start?**

Before Bio Academy, there was the Fab Academy which was developed to teach hands-on skills in fab labs and began as an outreach project from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms. It has grown into a global network of more than 500 labs. Fab Academy instruction is based on MIT’s popular rapid-prototyping course _How To Make (almost) Anything_, both taught by Prof. Neil Gershenfeld. Prof. George Church of Harvard then used the Fab Academy curriculum to develop a similar course that focusses on synthetic biology. Thus Bio Academy was born.

**How does it work?**

- The program takes place from end of August to late December
- Every week, faculty members hold a global lecture on a different topic
- Instructors in local labs provide hands-on activities on the topic, and offer their their practical knowledge to help students develop the week's assignment
- Students work on the assignment using lab materials, equipment and machines, immediately applying all the concepts covered in the global and local classes. All the materials are included in the tuition fees.
- Students document their progress in a personal blog hosted in the [Bio Academy Archive](http://bio.academany.org/doc)
- In parallel to the weekly assignments, students work on a personal final project which will integrate mastery of all the skills learned during the course
- Students who complete all modules and final project go through a global evaluation process that leads to the Bio Academy Diploma


**What will I learn?**

Bio Academy teaches the principles and application of synthetic biology. The course is devided into multiple classes, covering the following topics:

* (Open) Hardware for Engineering Biology
* Next generation synthesis
* DNA Nanostructures
* Cell-Free Production
* Darwin on steroids: Bio design, diversity & selection
* Bio production
* Bio molecule sensors
* Genome Engineering
* Fluorescence In Situ Sequencing (FISSEQ)
* Synthetic development biology
* Bio Fabrication and Additive manufacturing
* Engineering the Gut Microbiome
* Gene Drives & Synthetic Ecosystems
* Invention, intellectual property and more

**How much time does it take?**


**Tuition fees**

Bio Academy Diploma costs 5,000 (USD/€). The currency is determined by local lab.

Included in the costs:
* All the basic course materials
* Access to all videos for lectures and reviews
* Access to the Bio Academy Video Conferencing system (MCU) and Bio Academy Archive
* 15 hours a week of hands-on Bio Lab access and personal instruction
* Use of the lab equipment and facilities
* Free access to the Annual FABX conference and diploma award ceremony where the student is graduating
* Free software licenses for selected Autodesk and Solidworks software packages during the course

**Scholarships**

You can apply for a partial grant or a scholarship to your local lab, often provided in exchange of some work contribution to the lab.

**Is there any accreditation?**

There is no global accreditation for these skills. Instead, each student builds a portfolio that documents their mastery of them individually, and their integration.

These are reviewed by their local instructors, regional gurus, and then centrally to ensure that each student meets global standards and follows evolving best practices.

The Bio Academy Diploma is earned by progress rather than the calendar, for successful completion of a series of certificate requirements. The instructional sequence requires six months to cover, and the time to finish has ranged from that up to a few years.
